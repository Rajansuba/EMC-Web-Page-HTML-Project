<p>In this tutorial, we‚Äôll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.</p>
<p>You can see what we‚Äôll be building here: Final Result. If the code doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code‚Äôs syntax, don‚Äôt worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.</p>
<p>We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you‚Äôll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game‚Äôs board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses</p>
<p>You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you‚Äôre familiar with it. We‚Äôll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game</p>
